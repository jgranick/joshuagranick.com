> God shall arise, his enemies shall be scattered

> Father of the fatherless and protector of widows is God in his holy habitation. God settles the solitary in a home; he leads out the prisoners to prosperity,  but the rebellious dwell in a parched land. O God, when you went out before your people, when you marched through the wilderness, the earth quaked, the heavens poured down rain,  before God, the One of Sinai, before God, the God of Israel. Rain in abundance, O God, you shed abroad; you restored your inheritance as it languished; your flock found a dwelling in it;  in your goodness, O God, you provided for the needy.
> 
> The Lord gives the word; the women who announce the news are a great host: "The kings of the armies—they flee, they flee!" Our God is a God of salvation, and to GOD, the Lord, belong deliverances from death. Awesome is God from his sanctuary;  the God of Israel—he is the one who gives power and strength to his people.

> Excerpts taken from Psalm 68

Our God is a God of salvation, and he is unstoppable.

His heart is to protect and defend the helpless, the weak, the broken-hearted and those who can "help themselves"

He is strong. He is mighty to interrupt the status quo and redefine "the way things are."

He plays by his own rules. He supercedes the "laws" of bondage, sin and death. He breaks chains. He utters "life" and men rise from ashes.

He gives us beauty for our ugliness; wholeness for our inadequacy. He fills where we are empty.

We abandon ourselves to be adopted. We release our hopes to receive the hope of the world.

Open yourself to a holy invasion -- surrender.
