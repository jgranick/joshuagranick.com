"Starting over" is a phrase which can feel overused, but are there times when you feel so refreshed or encouraged, its as if you've been given another chance?

In "Laughing Your Way To A Better Marriage," Mark Gungor explained the reset button. He said no matter how much better his son was at video games, he liked that he could press the reset button and put them on a level playing field again. Obviously that might be a difficult circumstance from the son's perspective, but sometimes all of us need the ability to restart and put things back the way they were before, and to return to where things were okay and fair.

I feel the need to take the time to refresh and restart more often, but luckily I have a wife and family that is really gracious and compassionate with me. I'm so fortunate to be married to such a wonderful and understanding woman!

Today, I just need to take a break. Tomorrow, I embark on lining up priorities and sketching out some vision.
