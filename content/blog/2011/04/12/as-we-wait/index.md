Have you ever had a hard time waiting?

We all know that there are the ordinary kinds of waiting that we experience almost every day -- a stop light, a line at the store, an order at the restaurant. These kinds of waiting tend to end almost as quickly as they begin. These "pauses" can feel very refreshing, or they sometimes they feel like an awful nuisance.

However, waiting can also have higher stakes. We do not always know how long we will be waiting. What if disaster will come if we do not receive an answer? Waiting is sometimes like fearing the dark -- we do not know what we do not see, and we are afraid of the worst possibilities.

There is a home that is for sale that my wife and I have followed for the past year. We have not been ready to buy, but have been keeping our eyes open as we save and prepare. I wonder how the home owners might feel, perhaps not knowing that someone is interested? There are always things that we cannot see while we are in a waiting period. Our answer may require time.<!--more-->

"Help is on the way."

I have been interviewing for a position I am really excited about. It has not always been easy to wait, wondering how the process will be resolved. When will I receive the answer? Will it be the answer I was hoping for? Even when we do not see what is happening, progress is often occurring.

Flowers, like selling houses or beginning a new job, often require time before they can bloom. As you wait, make sure that you nurture, and remember that waiting is part of the process. One day, the progress that was made out of sight may finally come to fruition.
