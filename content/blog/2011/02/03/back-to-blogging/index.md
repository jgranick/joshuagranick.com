I miss the good old days.

Not the good old days when we used to make our own paper or when we shouted instead of using the telephone... the days when email was king, IM was fresh and blogging was the cutting edge of "social media."

Do you remember?

There's an intriguing draw to writing and reading short thoughts and quips. Facebook and Twitter, in their own way, have shown us that less *is* more sometimes... but I've had enough. I miss the old days when thoughts were complete, when we wrote in paragraphs and not sentences.

There is something about a well-written blog post which reminds me of a deep conversation. Sure there's "hi" and "hello," but you get past that to get to the substance which lies underneath all our politeness. It demands greater investment from both the speaker and the listener, but we may find that there are rich rewards to be discovered when we go below the surface.

I'm not one to often make New Year's resolutions, but this time I decided to blog more.

This is the first step.

That wasn't so difficult, was it?
