> And he who was seated on the throne said, "Behold, I am making all things new." Also he said, "Write this down, for these words are trustworthy and true." (Revelation 21:5)

Reset.

This year is going to be different than previous years. Everything we hold dear may be shaken but that does not mean that we will lose what is truly valuable. Shaking can reveal the foundation beneath the above-ground things we see, for better or for worse.

When all is revealed are we exposed or are we recognized? Would you expect to hear a howl of shame or shout of celebration when the hidden is made public?

Clearing can make way for new beginnings.

We are in Colorado. What to expect?
