It can be hard to keep fighting, especially when it feels as if the odds are stacked against you. There's a little part of us that wants to lie down and just hope that the difficulties we face will blow over on their own. Not so. We need to keep at it, encuraging ourselves to fight for what matters and not allow ourselves the false security of sleep.

Rest, of course, is crucial element, but true rest -- rest of mind and heart as well as of body. That sort of rest is rejuvenating, enabling us to get up and continue. Laziness stays down, and many times never truly rests, but simply lounges. Vision and direction rise up and keep forging ahead and taking new ground.

I need to keep moving. I need to stay awake.
