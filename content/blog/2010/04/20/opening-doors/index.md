I feel that God is opening a door, but I'm not yet sure if this next door means the end of business as we know it, or if breakthrough is about to come. We need finances, regardless of how you look at it, but I know that they will be provided for one way or another. There is an anxious impatience which can demand immediate results, but it isn't helpful. You keep moving forward, pursuing every avenue you feel led to pursue, and you wait, and allow God to bring the right opportunity to fruition. The right door will open, I believe it.
