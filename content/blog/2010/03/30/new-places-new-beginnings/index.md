It's remarkable to consider all of the ways that this past year has been unpredictable. The only constant is change, they say, and that's especially been true for us. I guess things have finally begun to calm down, prompting me to reflect and consider more fully what I value most and what I really want my life to look like.

It's easy when you're coming and going to never truly engage and really dig deep where you are. Now that things have had the opportunity to settle down, I think it's time to make the life I want to live begin right now. Of course that doesn't mean that I'm to force the process along, but sometimes we need to be active in order to enter into the things we're meant to.

I really hope that God shows me how to walk with all the responsibilities I have in a way that satisfies and succeeds all of the goals that I should meet. I'll just trust that He is the one who knows best, and who knows what steps I should really be taking and what relationships should be deepened.
