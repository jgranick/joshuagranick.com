Stop and take a moment. Slow down. Breathe.

Did you know that today is a gift? There are surprises, joys and sparks of whimsy placed *purposely* in this day. Look and notice, try and find them like hidden treasures.

It starts with feeling the ground beneath your toes and the gentle comfort of air filling your lungs. Today I had the pleasure of watching two sets of quail attempting to cross the road. One was partially across the road when he saw me coming and began running. Behind him two to three friends and relations got even more panicked, trying to follow in line while getting out of the way of impending metal. Next it was in the kindness of the man helping me in the produce section at the grocery store. Then it was the way a woman had her small dog bundled in a blanket like a big swaddling blanket.

In the sunrise, the mountains, the trees, the bushes, the flowers, the birds, the lizards, people, children, animals, critters and even insects. Take the time to watch an ant and you may discover (as you probably had as a child) a sense of wonder. Let that wonder reconnect you with the beautiful present moment. Today is different than any other day that has ever existed. What beautiful, interesting or cute things can you find in *this* day? ...in *this* moment? Take the time to sabbath, or rest, in this instant right now. You are loved. You are acceptable as you are. There is good in the world. Life is still worth living. You are not alone.

Those who think they are alone forget the one who's always been there.
